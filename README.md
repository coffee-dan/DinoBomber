# DinoBomber
## Background
DinoBomber is a 2D javascript game, it is designed based on the concept of the classic Bobmberman game. Game will be played on a grid based map which has trees and rocks as obstacles. There are four game charactors: 
    - cute green dino (main charactor, controlled by the player)
    - soldier #1 (walking randomly on the map)
    - soldier #2 (chasing dino)
    - soldier #3 (walking in his own zone, if dino is close by, walking away from the dino)

Dino can drop eggs on empty path, and each egg will explode in 3s and will clear out the surrounding trees. Dino can eat apples to to drop super eggs, which will explode in 5s and clear out the trees on the egg row and column.
